# After editing this file, run "badmin reconfig" to apply your changes.

# Misc batch parameters/switches of the LSF system

# LSF administrator will receive all the error mails produced by LSF
# and have the permission to reconfigure the system (Use an ordinary user
# name, or create a special account such as lsf. Don't define as root)

# The parameter values given below are for the purpose of testing a new
# installation.  Jobs submitted to the LSF system will be started on
# batch server hosts quickly.  However, this configuration may not be
# suitable for a production use.  You may need some control on job scheduling,
# such as jobs should not be started when host load is high, a host should not
# accept more than one job within a short period time, and job scheduling
# interval should be longer to give hosts some time adjusting load indices
# after accepting jobs.
#

Begin Parameters
DEFAULT_QUEUE  = cloud # Default job queue names
MBD_SLEEP_TIME = 10       # Amount of time in seconds used for calculating parameter values
SBD_SLEEP_TIME = 7       # sbatchd scheduling interval
JOB_SCHEDULING_INTERVAL=1 # Interval between job scheduling sessions
JOB_ACCEPT_INTERVAL = 0   # Interval for any host to accept a job
ABS_RUNLIMIT=Y     # Absolute run time is used instead of normalized one
JOB_DEP_LAST_SUB=1 # LSF evaluates only the most recently submitted job name for dependency conditions

MAX_CONCURRENT_QUERY=100 # Concurrent queries mbatchd can handle
MAX_JOB_NUM=10000  # The maximum number of finished jobs whose events are to be stored in the lsb.events log file

PARALLEL_SCHED_BY_SLOT=y # Schedule parallel jobs based on slots
NEWJOB_REFRESH=y  # Enhancement for query mbatchd new job information update
RELAX_JOB_DISPATCH_ORDER = Y # enable relaxed job dispatch order in the cluster
JOB_ARRAY_EVENTS_COMBINE = Y # enable generating combined event logs with the format of array index ranges for array jobs
